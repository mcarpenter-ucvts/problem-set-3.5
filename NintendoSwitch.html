      <h2>Console Information</h2>
<p>The Nintendo Switch is the seventh major video game console developed by Nintendo. Considered by Nintendo as "hybrid" console, it is designed as a home console, with the main unit inserted onto <br/><br/> a docking station to connect to a television. Alternatively, it can be removed from the dock and used similarly to a tablet computer through its LCD touchscreen, or placed in a standalone tabletop<br/><br/> mode visible to several players. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers, which include standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and high-definition tactile feedback, <br/><br/>can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. </p>
