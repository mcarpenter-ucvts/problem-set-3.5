      <h2>Console Information</h2>


<p id="2">The Nintendo Switch is the seventh major video game console developed by Nintendo. Considered by Nintendo as a "hybrid" console, it is designed as a home console, with the main unit inserted onto a docking station to connect to a television. Alternatively, it can be removed from the dock and used similarly to a tablet computer through its LCD touchscreen, or placed in a standalone tabletop mode visible to several players. Its wireless Joy-Con controllers, which include standard buttons and directional analog sticks for user input, motion sensing, and high-definition tactile feedback, can attach to both sides of the console to support handheld-style play. </p>

<h2>Variants of The Console And Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Nintendo Switch</li><p id="note">Unlike the PS4 and the Xbox, the Nintendo Switch does not have any variants of itself. The original version is the only version made by Nintendo. The Nintendo Switch does come with removeable joy-con controllers that you can swap out for different colors to make your Switch however you want it. Nintendo does, however, sell the Nintendo Switch with other colored joy-con controllers out of the box so you have different options to start off with.
    <ul>
    <li>Dock the Switch into the provided dock to enjoy games on a TV</li>
    <br/>
      <li>Play on the Switch anywhere you go in handheld mode</li>
      <br/>
      <li>Flip out the stand on the back of the Switch to play with friends using the Joy-con controllers</li>
    </ul>
    </ul>
